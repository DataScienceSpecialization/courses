## Classes and Methods

- A system for doing object oriented programming
- R was originally quite interesting because it is both interactive _and_ has a system for object orientation.
    - Other languages which support OOP (C++, Java, Lisp, Python, Perl) generally speaking are not interactive languages
- In R much of the code for supporting classes/methods is written by John Chambers himself (the creator of the original S language) and documented in the book _Programming with Data: A Guide to the S Language_

- A natural extension of Chambers’ idea of allowing someone to cross the user −→ programmer spectrum
- Object oriented programming is a bit different in R than it is in most languages — even if you are familiar with the idea, you may want to pay attention to the details

## Two styles of classes and methods

S3 classes/methods
- Included with version 3 of the S language. 
- Informal, a little kludgey
- Sometimes called _old-style_ classes/methods

S4 classes/methods
- more formal and rigorous
- Included with S-PLUS 6 and R 1.4.0 (December 2001) 
- Also called _new-style_ classes/methods

---

## Two worlds living side by side

- For now (and the forseeable future), S3 classes/methods and S4 classes/methods are separate systems (but they can be mixed to some degree).
- Each system can be used fairly independently of the other.
- Developers of new projects (you!) are encouraged to use the S4 style classes/methods.
    - Used extensively in the Bioconductor project
- But many developers still use S3 classes/methods because they are “quick and dirty” (and easier).
- In this lecture we will focus primarily on S4 classes/methods
- The code for implementing S4 classes/methods in R is in the *methods* package, which is usually loaded by default (but you can load it with `library(methods)` if for some reason it is not loaded)

---

## Object Oriented Programming in R

- A class is a description of an thing. A class can be defined using `setClass()` in the *methods* package.
- An _object_ is an instance of a class. Objects can be created using `new()`. 
- A _method_ is a function that only operates on a certain class of objects.
- A generic function is an R function which dispatches methods. A generic function typically encapsulates a “generic” concept (e.g. `plot`, `mean`, `predict`, ...)
    - The generic function does not actually do any computation.
- A _method_ is the implementation of a generic function for an object of a particular class.

---

## Things to look up

- The help files for the ‘methods’ package are extensive — do read them as they are the primary documentation
- You may want to start with `?Classes` and `?Methods` 
- Check out `?setClass`, `?setMethod`, and `?setGeneric`
- Some of it gets technical, but try your best for now—it will make sense in the future as you keep using it.
- Most of the documentation in the *methods* package is oriented towards developers/programmers as these are the primary people using classes/methods

---

## Classes

All objects in R have a class which can be determined by the class function

```{r}
class(1)
class(TRUE)
```

---

## Classes

```{r}
class(rnorm(100))
class(NA)
class("foo")
```

---

## Classes (cont’d)

Data classes go beyond the atomic classes

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
fit <- lm(y ~ x)  ## linear regression model
class(fit)
```

---

## Generics/Methods in R

- S4 and S3 style generic functions look different but conceptually, they are the same (they play the same role).
- When you program you can write new methods for an existing generic OR create your own generics and associated methods.
- Of course, if a data type does not exist in R that matches your needs, you can always define a new class along with generics/methods that go with it

---

## An S3 generic function (in the ‘base’ package)

The `mean` and `print` functions are generic 
```{r}
mean
print
```

---

## S3 methods

The `mean` generic function has a number of methods associated with it.

```{r}
methods("mean")
```

---

## An S4 generic function

The `show` function is from the <b>methods</b> package and is the S4
equivalent of `print`
```{r}
show
```
The `show` function is usually not called directly (much like `print`)
because objects are auto-printed.

---

## S4 methods

```{r}
showMethods("show")
```

---

## Generic/method mechanism

The first argument of a generic function is an object of a particular class (there may be other arguments)

1. The generic function checks the class of the object.
2. A search is done to see if there is an appropriate method for that class.
3. If there exists a method for that class, then that method is called on the object and we’re done.
4. If a method for that class does not exist, a search is done to see if there is a default method for the generic. If a default exists, then the default method is called.
5. If a default method doesn’t exist, then an error is thrown.

---

## Examining Code for Methods

- You cannot just print the code for a method like other functions because the code for the method is usually hidden.
- If you want to see the code for an S3 method, you can use the function `getS3method`.
- The call is `getS3method(<generic>, <class>)`
- For S4 methods you can use the function `getMethod`
- The call is `getMethod(<generic>, <signature>)` (more details later)

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 1

What’s happening here?

```{r}
set.seed(2)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

1. The class of x is “numeric”
2. But there is no mean method for “numeric” objects!
3. So we call the default function for `mean`.

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 1

```{r}
head(getS3method("mean", "default"), 10)
```

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 1

```{r}
tail(getS3method("mean", "default"), 10)
```

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 2

What happens here?

```{r}
set.seed(3)
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = 1:100)
sapply(df, mean)
```

1. The class of `df` is "data.frame"; each column can be an object of
a different class

2. We `sapply` over the columns and call the `mean` function

3. In each column, `mean` checks the class of the object and dispatches the
appropriate method.

4. We have a `numeric` column and an `integer` column; `mean` calls the default method for both

---

## Calling Methods Directly

* Some S3 methods are visible to the user (i.e. `mean.default`),

* <b>Never</b> call methods directly

* Use the generic function and let the method be dispatched
automatically.

* With S4 methods you cannot call them directly at all

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 3

The `plot` function is generic and its behavior depends on the object being plotted. 

```{r,out.height=300,out.width=300}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
```

---

## S3 Class/Method: Example 3

For time series objects, `plot` connects the dots

```{r,out.height=300,out.width=300}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
x <- as.ts(x) ## Convert to a time series object 
plot(x)
```

---

## Write your own methods!

If you write new methods for new classes, you’ll probably end up writing methods for the following generics:
- print/show 
- summary 
- plot

There are two ways that you can extend the R system via classes/methods
- Write a method for a new class but for an existing generic function (i.e. like
`print`)
- Write new generic functions and new methods for those generics

---

## S4 Classes

Why would you want to create a new class?
- To represent new types of data (e.g. gene expression, space-time, hierarchical, sparse matrices)
- New concepts/ideas that haven’t been thought of yet (e.g. a fitted point process model, mixed-effects model, a sparse matrix)
- To abstract/hide implementation details from the user
I say things are “new” meaning that R does not know about them (not that they are new to the statistical community).

---

## S4 Class/Method: Creating a New Class

A new class can be defined using the `setClass` function
- At a minimum you need to specify the name of the class
- You can also specify data elements that are called _slots_
- You can then define methods for the class with the `setMethod` function Information about a class definition can be obtained with the `showClass` function

---

## S4 Class/Method: Polygon Class

Creating new classes/methods is usually not something done at the console; you likely want to save the code in a separate file

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
library(methods)
setClass("polygon",
         representation(x = "numeric",
                        y = "numeric"))
```

- The slots for this class are `x`and `y`

- The slots for an S4 object can be accessed with the `@` operator.

---

## S4 Class/Method: Polygon Class

A plot method can be created with the `setMethod` function.

- For `setMethod` you need to specify a generic function (`plot`), and
  a _signature_.

- A signature is a character vector indicating the classes of objects
  that are accepted by the method.

- In this case, the `plot` method will take one type of object, a
  `polygon` object.

---

## S4 Class/Method: Polygon Class

Creating a `plot` method with `setMethod`.

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
setMethod("plot", "polygon",
          function(x, y, ...) {
                  plot(x@x, x@y, type = "n", ...)
                  xp <- c(x@x, x@x[1])
                  yp <- c(x@y, x@y[1])
                  lines(xp, yp)
	  })
```

- Notice that the slots of the polygon (the x- and y-coordinates) are
  accessed with the `@` operator.

---

## S4 Class/Method: Polygon Class

After calling `setMethod` the new `plot` method will be added to the list of methods for `plot`.

```{r}
library(methods)
showMethods("plot")
```

Notice that the signature for class `polygon` is listed. The method for `ANY` is the default method and it is what is called when now other signature matches

---

## S4 Class/Method: Polygon class

```{r,out.height=400,out.width=400}
p <- new("polygon", x = c(1, 2, 3, 4), y = c(1, 2, 3, 1))
plot(p)
```

---


## Summary

- Developing classes and associated methods is a powerful way to
  extend the functionality of R

- <b>Classes</b> define new data types

- <b>Methods</b> extend <b>generic functions</b> to specificy the behavior
    of generic functions on new classes

- As new data types and concepts are created, classes/methods provide
  a way for you to develop an intuitive interface to those
  data/concepts for users

---

## Where to Look, Places to Start

- The best way to learn this stuff is to look at examples

- There are quite a few examples on CRAN which use S4
  classes/methods. You can usually tell if they use S4 classes/methods
  if the <b>methods</b> package is listed in the `Depends:` field

- Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org) — a rich resource, even
  if you know nothing about bioinformatics

- Some packages on CRAN (as far as I know) — SparseM, gpclib, flexmix,
  its, lme4, orientlib, filehash

- The `stats4` package (comes with R) has a bunch of classes/methods
for doing maximum likelihood analysis.  ￼￼￼￼￼
