## First Announcement

Welcome to Week 1 of the Statistical Inference, part of the Coursera
Data Science specialization from Johns Hopkins Biostatistics! This
course presents the fundamentals of statistical inference that you
will need throughout the rest of the Data Science track.

We believe that the key word in Data Science is "science". Our course
track is focused on providing you with three things: (1) an
introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific
way that will produce new and reproducible insight, (2) an
introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data
analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report
with interactive graphics, and (3) on giving you plenty of hands on
practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself.

This course represents the most fundamental and foundational
component of the series. Using only a bare minimum of mathematics,
we attempt to give students the fundamentals of using statistics
to draw inferences about populations. 

We are excited about the opportunity to attempt to scale Data Science
education. We intend for the courses to be self contained, fast paced,
and interactive. We intend to run them frequently to give people with
busy schedules the opportunity to work on material at their own pace.

Please see the course syllabus for information about the quizes, the
project, due dates, and grading. Don't forget to say hi on the message
boards. The community developed around these courses is one of the
best places to learn and the best things about taking a MOOC!

## Course wrap-up

Congratulations on finishing the Statistical Inference!

We have set the grading and released the Statements of Accomplishment
for the Course. It might take a few hours/days for the statements to
be disbursed to accounts.

A couple of other notes:

* The course will begin again immediately starting in a couple of
days. If you are still interested in keeping in touch with your
fellow learners, please enroll in the new course and keep the conversation going. You may also be an invaluable resource for 
new course takers!
* Keep your eye on Hopkins offerings from Coursera. All announcements about future offerings will be posted at: https://twitter.com/jhubiostat and http://simplystatistics.org/, http://twitter.com/simplystats. 
* If you liked this course, please consider taking some of the other course offerings through the Data Science Track. If you have completed all the course work in this track you now have the tools you will need to take on the challenges in the rest of our courses or in other Statistics, Data Science, or Machine Learning courses you may encounter. 

Thanks again for all of your efforts during the course of the class and best of luck in your career!
