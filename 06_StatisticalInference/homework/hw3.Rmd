Load the data set `mtcars` in the `datasets` R package. Calculate a 
95% confidence interval to the nearest MPG.

1. What is the lower endpoint of the interval?
2. What is the upper endpoint of the interval?

*** .hint
Do `library(datasets)` and then `data(mtcars)` to get the data.
Consider `t.test` for calculations. You may have to install
the datasets package.


*** .explanation
```{r}
library(datasets); data(mtcars)
round(t.test(mtcars$mpg)$conf.int)
```

<span class="answer">`r round(min(t.test(mtcars$mpg)$conf.int))`</span>
<span class="answer">`r round(max(t.test(mtcars$mpg)$conf.int))`</span>

Suppose that data of 9 paired differences has a standard error of $1$, what value would the average difference have to be to have the lower endpoint of a 95%
students t confidence interval touch zero?

1. Give the number here to two decimal places

*** .hint
The t interval is $\bar x t_{.95, 8}\pm s /sqrt{n}$

*** .explanation
<span class="answer">`r round(qt(.95, df = 8) * 1 / 3, 2)`</span>

We want $\bar x = t_{.95} s / sqrt{n}$
```{r}
round(qt(.95, df = 8) * 1 / 3, 2)
```

An independent group Student's T interval is used over
a paired T interval when:

1. The observations are paired between the groups.
2. _The observations between the groups are natually assumed to be statistically independent_
3. As long as you do it correctly, either is fine.
4. More details are needed to answer this question

*** .hint
A paired interval is for paired observations.

*** .explanation
We can't pair them if the groups are independent of each other as well as independent within themselves.

Consider the `mtcars` dataset. Construct a 95% T interval for MPG comparing
4 to 6 cylinder cars (subtracting in the order of 4 - 6) 
assume a constant variance.

1. What is the lower endpoint of the interval to 1 decimal place?
2. What is the upper endpoint of the interval to 1 decimal place?

*** .hint
Use `t.test` with `var.equal=TRUE`

*** .explanation

```{r}
m4 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 4]
m6 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 6]
#this does 4 - 6
confint <- as.vector(t.test(m4, m6, var.equal = TRUE)$conf.int)
```

<span class="answer">`r round(min(confint), 1)`</span>
<span class="answer">`r round(max(confint), 1)`</span>

If someone put a gun to your head and said "Your confidence interval
must contain what it's estimating or I'll pull the trigger", what would
be the smart thing to do?

1. _Make your interval as wide as possible_
2. Make your interval as small as possible
3. Call the authorities

*** .hint
C'mon. You don't need a hint

*** .explanation
This is just an example of what happens to confidence intervals as you
increase the confidence level. You want to be quite sure in your interval (i.e.
have a large confidence level) and so you would increase the interval's width

--- &radio

Refer back to comparing MPG for 4 versus 6 cylinders. What do you conclude?

1. The interval is above zero, suggesting 6 is better than 4 in the terms of MPG
2. _The interval is above zero, suggesting 4 is better than 6 in the terms of MPG_
3. The interval does not tell you anything about the hypothesis test; you have to do the test.
4. The interval contains 0 suggesting no difference.

*** .hint
Refer back to the problem, consider the implications of the interval being
larger than 0, double check the order in which things were subtracted and
make sure the results make sense in the context of the problem.

*** .explanation
The interval was conducted subtracting 4 - 6 and was entirely above zero.

Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. Subjects' body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) was 3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The study aims to answer whether the change in BMI over the four week period appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups. 

What is the pooled variance estimate? (to 2 decimal places)


*** .hint
The sample sizes are equal, so the pooled variance is the average of the 
individual variances


*** .explanation
```{r}
n1 <- n2 <- 9
x1 <- -3  ##treated
x2 <- 1  ##placebo
s1 <- 1.5  ##treated
s2 <- 1.8  ##placebo
spsq <- ( (n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2)
```
<span class="answer">`r round(spsq, 2)`</span>

For Binomial data the maximum likelihood estimate for the probability of 
a success is

1. _The proportion of successes_
2. The proportion of failures
3. A shrunken version of the proportion of successes
4. A shrunken version of the proportion of failures

*** .hint
Look back at the notes about likelihood.

*** .explanation
The MLE for binomial data is always the proportion of successes.

Bayesian inference requires

1. A type I error rate
2. Setting your confidence level
3. _Assigning a prior probability distribution_
4. Evaluating frequency error rates

*** .explanation
All of the other answers discuss frequentist concepts. All Bayesian analyses requiring setting a prior.
