## Week 1 Announcement

Welcome to Week 1 of Prediction and Machine Learning! This course
will focus on developing the tools and techniques for understanding, building, and testing prediction functions. 

These tools are at the center of the Data Science revolution. Many
researchers, companies, and governmental organizations would like to use the cheap and abundant data they are collecting to predict
what customers will like, what services to offer, or how to improve people's lives. 

The emphasis of this course is hands on learning and implementation. If you like what you learn in this class, there are a large number of other Machine and Statistical Learning MOOCs that you can use to deepen your knowledge.

Please see the course syllabus for information about the quizes, the project, due dates, and grading. Don't forget to say hi on the message boards. The community developed around these courses is one of the best places to learn and the best things about taking a MOOC!

## Week 2 Announcement

Welcome to Week 2 of Prediction and Machine Learning! This will be the most lecture-intensive week of the course. The primary goal is to introduce you to how to build predictors in practice. 

Remember that the course project is open and ongoing. With the skills you learn this week you should be able to start on the basic analyses that will form the beginnings of your project. 

Good luck and have a great week!

## Week 3 Announcement


Welcome to Week 3 of Prediction and Machine Learning! This week we will start to reduce the number of lectures so you can spend more time focusing on your course project. Your project is due at the end of this week. 

If you have trouble or want to explore issues in more depth, please seek out answers on the message boards. They are a great resource! If you happen to be a superstar who already gets it, please take the time to help your classmates by answering their questions as well. This is one of the best ways to practice using and explaining your skills to others. These are two of the key characteristics of excellent data scientists.

Good luck and have a great week!

## Week 4 Announcement


Welcome to Week 4 of Prediction and Machine Learning! In this final week we will focus on peer grading of assignments. 

Participating in peer grading is an amazing learning opportunity. It gives you a chance to learn things from your fellow students,
pick up tips for explaning key ideas, and helping others to learn as well. We have focused our effort on making the rubric as objective and straightforward to implement as possible. If you have any issues please report them in the forums as described in the syllabus. 

Thanks again for all of your efforts in the course, we are in the last stretch. Good luck and have a great week!

## Course wrap-up

Congratulations on finishing Prediction and Machine Learning!

We have set the grading and released the Statements of Accomplishment for the Course. It might take a few hours/days for the statements to be disbursed to accounts.

A couple of other notes:

* The course will begin again immediately starting in a couple of
days. If you are still interested in keeping in touch with your
fellow learners, please enroll in the new course and keep the conversation going. You may also be an invaluable resource for 
new course takers!
* Keep your eye on Hopkins offerings from Coursera. All announcements about future offerings will be posted at: https://twitter.com/jhubiostat and http://simplystatistics.org/, http://twitter.com/simplystats. 
* If you liked this course, please consider taking some of the other course offerings through the Data Science Track. 
* If you have cool projects you created through the course, please
Tweet them to either of the addresses above so we can see them!

Thanks again for all of your efforts during the course of the class and best of luck in your career!
