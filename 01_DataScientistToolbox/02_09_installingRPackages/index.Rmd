## R Packages

- When you download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN),
  you get that ``base" R system

- The base R system comes with basic functionality; implements the R language

- One reason R is so useful is the large collection of packages that
  extend the basic functionality of R

- R packages are developed and published by the larger R community

--- 

## Obtaining R Packages

- The primary location for obtaining R packages is
  [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)

- For biological applications, many packages are available from the
  [Bioconductor Project](http://bioconductor.org)

- You can obtain information about the available packages on CRAN with
  the `available.packages()` function

```{r,cache=TRUE}
a <- available.packages()
head(rownames(a), 3)  ## Show the names of the first few packages
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
n <- signif(nrow(a), 2)
```

- There are approximately `r n` packages on CRAN covering a wide range of topics

- A list of some topics is available through the [Task
  Views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) link, which groups
  together many R packages related to a given topic

---

## Installing an R Package

- Packages can be installed with the `install.packages()`
  function in R

- To install a single package, pass the name of the package to the
  `install.packages()` function as the first argument

- The following the code installs the **slidify** package from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("slidify")
```

- This command downloads the **slidify** package from CRAN and
  installs it on your computer

- Any packages on which this package depends will also be downloaded
  and installed

---

## Installing an R Package

- You can install multiple R packages at once with a single call to
  `install.packages()`

- Place the names of the R packages in a character vector

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("slidify", "ggplot2", "devtools"))
```

## Installing an R Package from Bioconductor

- To get the basic installer and basic set of R packages (warning, will install multiple packages)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
```

- Place the names of the R packages in a character vector

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocLite(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi"))
```

## Loading R Packages

- Installing a package does not make it immediately available to you
  in R; you must load the package

- The `library()` function is used to **load** packages into R

- The following code is used to load the **ggplot2** package into R

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

- Any packages that need to be loaded as dependencies will be loaded
  first, before the named package is loaded

- NOTE: Do not put the package name in quotes!

- Some packages produce messages when they are loaded (but some don't)

---

## Loading R Packages

After loading a package, the functions exported by that package will
be attached to the top of the `search()` list (after the workspace)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
search()
```

---

## Summary

- R packages provide a powerful mechanism for extending the
  functionality of R

- R packages can be obtained from CRAN or other repositories

- The `install.packages()` can be used to install packages at the R
  console

- The `library()` function loads packages that have been installed so
  that you may access the functionality in the package
