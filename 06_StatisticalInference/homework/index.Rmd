Consider influenza epidemics for two parent heterosexual families. Suppose that the probability is 15% that at least one of the parents has contracted the disease. The probability that the father has contracted influenza is 6% while that the mother contracted the disease is 5%. What is the probability that both contracted influenza?

1. 15%
2. _1%_
3. 6%
4. 5%

*** .hint
$A = Father$, $P(A) = .06$, $B = Mother$, $P(B) = .05$ 
$P(A\cup B) = .15$, 



*** .explanation
$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - 2 P(AB)$ thus
$$.15 = .06 + .05 - 2 P(AB)$$
