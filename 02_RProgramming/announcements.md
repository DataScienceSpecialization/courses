## Week 1 Announcement

I'm very excited to start R Programming and I hope you are too. As of now the course web site on Coursera is open and you are free to start watching lecture videos, take the quizzes, and look at the first programming assignment.

As you browse the course web site, please make sure to read through the <b>syllabus</b> which contains important information about the grading policy for quizzes and programming assignments as well as the course schedule.

The primary way to interact with me in this course is through the <b>discussion forums</b>. Here, you can start new threads by asking questions or you can respond to other people's questions. If you have a question about any aspect of the course, I strongly suggest that you search through the discussion boards first to see if anyone as already asked that question. If you see something similar to what you want to ask, you should up-vote that question using the up-arrow button rather than asking your question separately. The more votes a question or comment gets, the more likely it is that I will see it and be able to respond quickly. Of course, if you don't see a question similar to the one you want to ask, then you should definitely start a new thread on the appropriate forum.

This week will cover the basics to get you started up with R. There are videos demonstrating how to install R on Windows and Mac. The Week 1 videos will cover the history of R and S, go over the basic data types in R, and describe the functions for reading and writing data. I recommend that you watch the videos in the order that they are listed on the web page, but watching the videos out of order isn't going to ruin the story. For each lecture video you can download a separate PDF document of the slides (the demonstration videos don't have slides
associated with them).

Watching the videos on the Coursera web site is the best way to watch the lectures. However, there are alternative ways to view the lectures if that suits you. You can download the lecture video MP4 files and watch them locally on your computer.

I hope you enjoy the class. I anticipate a fun four weeks!

## Week 2 Announcement

Today marks the beginning of Week 2 of R Programming. This week we take the gloves off and the lectures cover key topics like control structures and functions. We also introduce the first programming assignment for the course, which is due at the end of the week.

A few notes about the Programming Assignment:

1. Each part of the Assignment can be submitted an infinite number of times&mdash;there is no limit on the number of submissions.

2. For each part, we take your maximum score over all of your submissions.

3. There is a submission script that you will have to download to submit your assignment.

## Week 3 Announcement


We have now entered the third week of R Programming which also marks the halfway point. The lectures this week cover loop functions and the debugging tools in R. These aspects of R make R useful for both interactive work and writing longer code, and so they are commonly used in practice.

The Programming Assignment is challenging and so I encourage you to start early if you have the chance. It requires you to explore some of the more interesting aspects of the R language, including taking advantage of the scoping rules to implement state preservation in R objects. 

Note that the programming assignment this week is implemented as a <b>Peer Assessment</b> so you will not see it listed under the Programming Assignments section.

Best of luck!

## Week 4 Announcement


Welcome to Week 4 of R Programming! In this final week there is a Programming Assignment and we will focus on peer grading of last week's Programming Assignment. 

Participating in peer grading is an amazing learning opportunity. It gives you a chance to learn things from your fellow students, pick up tips for explaning key ideas, and helping others to learn as well. We have focused our effort on making the rubric as objective and straightforward to implement as possible. If you have any issues please report them in the forums as described in the syllabus. 

This weeks Programming Assignment uses data on hospital mortality rates in the United States from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This a large database that is used to evaluate hospital quality in the U.S. We will be scratching the surface of this dataset to explore hospital ranking.

Thanks again for all of your efforts in the course, we are in the last stretch. Good luck and have a great week!

## Course wrap-up

Congratulations on finishing R Programming!

We have set the grading and released the Statements of Accomplishment for the Course. It might take a few days for the statements to be disbursed to accounts.

A couple of other notes:

* The course will begin again immediately starting in a couple of days. If you are still interested in keeping in touch with your fellow learners, please enroll in the new course and keep the conversation going. You may also be an invaluable resource for new course takers!

* Keep your eye on Hopkins offerings from Coursera. All announcements about future offerings will be posted at: <a href ="https://twitter.com/jhubiostat">https://twitter.com/jhubiostat</a> and <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/">http://simplystatistics.org/</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/simplystats">http://twitter.com/simplystats</a>.

* If you liked this course, please consider taking some of the other
  course offerings through the Data Science Specialization. If you
  have completed all the course work in this track you now have the
  tools you will need to take on the challenges in the rest of our
  courses or in other Statistics, Data Science, or Machine Learning
  courses you may encounter.

Thanks again for all of your efforts during the course of the class
and best of luck in your career!
