## Reproducible Research: Week 1

I'm very excited to start Reproducible Research and I hope you are too. Reproducible research is the idea that for any data analysis or research product, the data and the computer code that went into doing that analysis is available to others so that they might examine what you've done and reproduce your findings. This idea is becoming increasingly important in the era of "Big Data" where data analyses are become more and more complicated and difficult to describe in plain language. This course will cover some of the tools that you can use to make your data analyses reproducible.

As of now the course web site on Coursera is open and you are free to start watching lecture videos, take the quizzes, and look at the first programming assignment. As you browse the course web site, please make sure to read through the <b>syllabus</b> which contains important information about the grading policy for quizzes and programming assignments as well as the course schedule.

The primary way to interact with me in this course is through the <b>discussion forums</b>. Here, you can start new threads by asking questions or you can respond to other people's questions. If you have a question about any aspect of the course, I strongly suggest that you search through the discussion boards first to see if anyone as already asked that question. If you see something similar to what you want to ask, you should up-vote that question using the up-arrow button rather than asking your question separately. The more votes a question or comment gets, the more likely it is that I will see it and be able to respond quickly. Of course, if you don't see a question similar to the one you want to ask, then you should definitely start a new thread on the appropriate forum.

This week will cover the basic ideas of reproducible research since they may be unfamiliar to some of you. We also cover structuring and organizing a data analysis to help make it more reproducible. I recommend that you watch the videos in the order that they are listed on the web page, but watching the videos out of order isn't going to ruin the story. For each lecture video you can download a separate PDF document of the slides (the demonstration videos don't have slides associated with them).

Watching the videos on the Coursera web site is the best way to watch the lectures. However, there are alternative ways to view the lectures if that suits you. You can download the lecture video MP4 files and watch them locally on your computer.

I hope you enjoy the class. I anticipate a fun four weeks!

## Reproducible Research: Week 2

Today marks the beginning of Week 2 of Reproducible Research. This week we cover some of the core tools for developing reproducible documents. We cover the literate programming tool knitr and show how to integrate it with Markdown to publish reproducible web documents. This week also introduces the first peer assessment which will require you to write up a reproducible data analysis using knitr.

## Reproducible Research: Week 3

Welcome to Week 3 of Reproducible Research. This week covers what I think of as a basic check list for ensuring that a data analysis is reproducible. While it's not absolutely sufficient follow the check list, I think it provides a necessary minimum standard that would be applicable to almost any area of analysis. I also present a series of videos on a new concept that I call "Evidence-based data analysis". 

There is a new Peer Assessment this week that involves writing up a data analysis using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Events database. The key questions to address there will be what types of events are most harmful to population health and what types of events have the greatest economic consequences.

This week there is <b>no Quiz</b>. I figured with the new Peer Assessment and the review of last week's Assessment you will have plenty to do for the week.

Good luck!

## Reproducible Research: Week 4

Welcome to Week 4 of Reproducible Research. This week there are two case studies involving the importance of reproducibility in science for you to watch. The first case study is an air pollution and health story in which I was personally involved. Here, researchers published some findings and we were able to use their data to test the sensitivity of their findings to outlier observations. The second case study is a real treat. It is given by Keith Baggerly, a Professor in the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Here, he discusses a case of "forensic bioinformatics" and his investigation into the use of gene signatures for personalized medicine. It's possible that you heard this story in the mainstream media (there was a feature on "60 Minutes"). Here, you can see the inside story.

This week there is **no Quiz**, but I encourage you to watch the case studies and learn from them. Also, you will spend this week evaluating the second Peer Assessment.

Have a great week!
