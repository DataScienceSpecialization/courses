## Why is My Code So Slow?

* Profiling is a systematic way to examine how much time is spend in
  different parts of a program

* Useful when trying to optimize your code

* Often code runs fine once, but what if you have to put it in a loop
  for 1,000 iterations? Is it still fast enough?

* Profiling is better than guessing

---

## On Optimizing Your Code


* Getting biggest impact on speeding up code depends on knowing where
the code spends most of its time

* This cannot be done without performance analysis or profiling


<blockquote>
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the
  time: premature optimization is the root of all evil
</blockquote>

--Donald Knuth

## General Principles of Optimization

* Design first, then optimize

* Remember: Premature optimization is the root of all evil

* Measure (collect data), don’t guess. 

* If you're going to be scientist, you need to apply the same
  principles here!

---

## Using `system.time()`

* Takes an arbitrary R expression as input (can be wrapped in curly
  braces) and returns the amount of time taken to evaluate the
  expression

* Computes the time (in seconds) needed to execute an expression
  - If there’s an error, gives time until the error occurred

* Returns an object of class `proc_time`
  - **user time**: time charged to the CPU(s) for this expression
  - **elapsed time**: "wall clock" time


---

## Using `system.time()`

* Usually, the user time and elapsed time are relatively close, for straight computing tasks

* Elapsed time may be *greater than* user time if the CPU spends a lot of time waiting around

* Elapsed time may be *smaller than* the user time if your machine
  has multiple cores/processors (and is capable of using them)
  - Multi-threaded BLAS libraries (vecLib/Accelerate, ATLAS, ACML, MKL)
  - Parallel processing via the **parallel** package

---

## Using `system.time()`

```r
## Elapsed time > user time
system.time(readLines("http://www.jhsph.edu"))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.004   0.002   0.431 

## Elapsed time < user time
hilbert <- function(n) { 
        i <- 1:n
        1 / outer(i - 1, i, "+”)
}
x <- hilbert(1000)
system.time(svd(x))
   user  system elapsed 
  1.605   0.094   0.742  
```

---

## Timing Longer Expressions

```{r}
system.time({
        n <- 1000
        r <- numeric(n)
        for(i in 1:n) {
                x <- rnorm(n)
                r[i] <- mean(x)
        }
})
```

---

## Beyond `system.time()`

* Using `system.time()` allows you to test certain functions or code
  blocks to see if they are taking excessive amounts of time

* Assumes you already know where the problem is and can call
  `system.time()` on it

* What if you don’t know where to start? 

---

## The R Profiler

* The `Rprof()` function starts the profiler in R
  - R must be compiled with profiler support (but this is usually the case)

* The `summaryRprof()` function summarizes the output from `Rprof()`
  (otherwise it’s not readable)

* DO NOT use `system.time()` and `Rprof()` together or you will be sad


---

## The R Profiler

* Rprof() keeps track of the function call stack at regularly sampled
  intervals and tabulates how much time is spend in each function

* Default sampling interval is 0.02 seconds

* NOTE: If your code runs very quickly, the profiler is not useful,
  but then you probably don't need it in that case


---

## R Profiler Raw Output

```r
## lm(y ~ x)

sample.interval=10000
"list" "eval" "eval" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"list" "eval" "eval" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"list" "eval" "eval" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"list" "eval" "eval" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"na.omit" "model.frame.default" "model.frame" "eval" "eval" "lm" 
"lm.fit" "lm" 
"lm.fit" "lm" 
"lm.fit" "lm" 
```

---

## Using `summaryRprof()`

* The `summaryRprof()` function tabulates the R profiler output and
  calculates how much time is spend in which function

* There are two methods for normalizing the data

* "by.total" divides the time spend in each function by the total run time

* "by.self" does the same but first subtracts out time spent in
  functions above in the call stack

## `summaryRprof()` Output

```r
$sample.interval
[1] 0.02

$sampling.time
[1] 7.41
```

## Summary

* `Rprof()` runs the profiler for performance of analysis of R code

* `summaryRprof()` summarizes the output of `Rprof()` and gives
  percent of time spent in each function (with two types of
  normalization)

* Good to break your code into functions so that the profiler can give
  useful information about where time is being spent

* C or Fortran code is not profiled
