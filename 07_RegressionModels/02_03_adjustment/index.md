## Consider the following simulated data
Code for the first plot, rest omitted
(See the git repo for the rest of the code.)
```
n <- 100; t <- rep(c(0, 1), c(n/2, n/2)); x <- c(runif(n/2), runif(n/2)); 
beta0 <- 0; beta1 <- 2; tau <- 1; sigma <- .2
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + t * tau + rnorm(n, sd = sigma)
plot(x, y, type = "n", frame = FALSE)
abline(lm(y ~ x), lwd = 2)
abline(h = mean(y[1 : (n/2)]), lwd = 3)
abline(h = mean(y[(n/2 + 1) : n]), lwd = 3)
fit <- lm(y ~ x + t)
abline(coef(fit)[1], coef(fit)[2], lwd = 3)
abline(coef(fit)[1] + coef(fit)[3], coef(fit)[2], lwd = 3)
points(x[1 : (n/2)], y[1 : (n/2)], pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue", cex = 2)
points(x[(n/2 + 1) : n], y[(n/2 + 1) : n], pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "salmon", cex = 2)
```

## Simulation 1
<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" class="plot" /></div>

## Discussion
### Some things to note in this simulation
* The X variable is unrelated to group status
* The X variable is related to Y, but the intercept depends
  on group status.
* The group variable is related to Y.
  * The relationship between group status and Y is constant depending on X.
  * The relationship between group and Y disregarding X is about the same as holding X constant

## Simulation 2

## Discussion
### Some things to note in this simulation
* The X variable is highly related to group status
* The X variable is related to Y, the intercept
  doesn't depend on the group variable.
  * The X variable remains related to Y holding group status constant
* The group variable is marginally related to Y disregarding X.
* The model would estimate no adjusted effect due to group. 
  * There isn't any data to inform the relationship between
    group and Y.
  * This conclusion is entirely based on the model.

## Simulation 3
<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" class="plot" /></div>


---
## Discussion
### Some things to note in this simulation
* Marginal association has red group higher than blue.
* Adjusted relationship has blue group higher than red.
* Group status related to X.
* There is some direct evidence for comparing red and blue
holding X fixed.

## Simulation 4
<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-4.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" class="plot" /></div>


---
## Discussion
### Some things to note in this simulation
* No marginal association between group status and Y.
* Strong adjusted relationship.
* Group status not related to X.
* There is lots of direct evidence for comparing red and blue
holding X fixed.

## Simulation 5
<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-5.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" class="plot" /></div>


---
## Discussion
### Some things to note from this simulation
* There is no such thing as a group effect here. 
  * The impact of group reverses itself depending on X.
  * Both intercept and slope depends on group.
* Group status and X unrelated.
  * There's lots of information about group effects holding X fixed.

### Simulation 6

### Do this to investigate the bivariate relationship
```
library(rgl)
plot3d(x1, x2, y)
```

---
### Residual relationship
<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-7.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" class="plot" /></div>



---
## Discussion
### Some things to note from this simulation

* X1 unrelated to X2
* X2 strongly related to Y
* Adjusted relationship between X1 and Y largely unchanged
  by considering X2.
  * Almost no residual variability after accounting for X2.

---
## Some final thoughts
* Modeling multivariate relationships is difficult.
* Play around with simulations to see how the
  inclusion or exclustion of another variable can
  change analyses.
* The results of these analyses deal with the
impact of variables on associations.
  * Ascertaining mechanisms or cause are difficult subjects 
    to be added on top of difficulty in understanding multivariate associations.
