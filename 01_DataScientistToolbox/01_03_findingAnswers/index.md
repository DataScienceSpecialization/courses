## A note on Googling data science questions

* The best place to start for general questions is the forums
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (use the tag "[r]"),[R mailing list](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) for software questions, [CrossValidated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) for more general questions
* 
* Otherwise Google "[data type] data analysis" or "[data type] R package"
* Try to identify what data analysis is called for your data type
  * [Biostatistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics) for medical data
  * [Data Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) for data from web analytics
  * [Machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) for data in computer science/computer vision
  * [Natural language processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing ) for data from texts
  * [Signal processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing) for data from electrical signals
  * [Business analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics) for data on customers
  * [Econometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) for economic data
  * [Statistical process control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control) for data about industrial processes 
  * etc.
