## A famous motivating example

```{r setup, cache = F, echo = F, message = F, warning = F, tidy = F, results='hide'}
# make this an external chunk that can be included in any file
options(width = 100)
opts_chunk$set(message = F, error = F, warning = F, comment = NA, fig.align = 'center', dpi = 100, tidy = F, cache.path = '.cache/', fig.path = 'fig/')

options(xtable.type = 'html')
knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
  if(is.numeric(x)) {
    round(x, getOption('digits'))
  } else {
    paste(as.character(x), collapse = ', ')
  }
})
knit_hooks$set(plot = knitr:::hook_plot_html)
runif(1)
```

## Questions for this class
* Consider trying to answer the following kinds of questions:
  * To use the parents' heights to predict childrens' heights.
  * To try to find a parsimonious, easily described mean 
    relationship between parent and children's heights.
  * To investigate the variation in childrens' heights that appears 
  unrelated to parents' heights (residual variation).
  * To quantify what impact genotype information has beyond parental height in explaining child height.
  * To figure out how/whether and what assumptions are needed to
    generalize findings beyond the data in question.  
  * Why do children of very tall parents tend to be 
    tall, but a little shorter than their parents and why children of very short parents tend to be short, but a little taller than their parents? (This is a famous question called 'Regression to the mean'.)

## Galton's Data

* Let's look at the data first, used by Francis Galton in 1885. 
* Galton was a statistician who invented the term and concepts
  of regression and correlation, founded the journal Biometrika,
  and was the cousin of Charles Darwin.
* You may need to run `install.packages("UsingR")` if the `UsingR` library is not installed.
* Let's look at the marginal (parents disregarding children and children disregarding parents) distributions first. 
  * Parent distribution is all heterosexual couples.
  * Correction for gender via multiplying female heights by 1.08.
  * Overplotting is an issue from discretization.

---
## Code

```{r galton,fig.height=3.5,fig.width=8}
library(UsingR); data(galton)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(galton$child,col="blue",breaks=100)
hist(galton$parent,col="blue",breaks=100)
```

---
## Finding the middle via least squares
* Consider only the children's heights. 
  * How could one describe the "middle"?
  * One definition, let $Y_i$ be the height of child $i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n = 928$, then define the middle as the value of $\mu$
  that minimizes $$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2$$
* This is physical center of mass of the histrogram.
* You might have guessed that the answer $\mu = \bar X$.


---
## Experiment
### Use R studio's manipulate to see what value of $\mu$ minimizes the sum of the squared deviations.

```
library(manipulate)
myHist <- function(mu){
  hist(galton$child,col="blue",breaks=100)
  lines(c(mu, mu), c(0, 150),col="red",lwd=5)
  mse <- mean((galton$child - mu)^2)
  text(63, 150, paste("mu = ", mu))
  text(63, 140, paste("MSE = ", round(mse, 2)))
}
manipulate(myHist(mu), mu = slider(62, 74, step = 0.5))
```

---
## The least squares estimate is the empirical mean
```{r lsm, dependson="galton",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
  hist(galton$child,col="blue",breaks=100)
  meanChild <- mean(galton$child)
  lines(rep(meanChild,100),seq(0,150,length=100),col="red",lwd=5)
```

---
### The math follows as:
$$ 
\begin{align} 
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2 & = \
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y + \bar Y - \mu)^2 \\ 
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)  (\bar Y - \mu) +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 (\bar Y - \mu) \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)  +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \
2 (\bar Y - \mu)  (\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i - n \bar Y) +\
\sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (\bar Y - \mu)^2\\ 
& \geq \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2 \
\end{align} 
$$

## Comparing childrens' heights and their parents' heights

```{r, dependson="galton",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(galton$parent,galton$child,pch=19,col="blue")
```

---
Size of point represents number of points at that (X, Y) combination (See the Rmd file for the code).

```{r freqGalton, dependson="galton",fig.height=6,fig.width=6,echo=FALSE}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
plot(as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$parent)), 
     as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$child)),
     pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
     cex = .15 * freqData$freq, 
     xlab = "parent", ylab = "child")
```

---
## Regression through the origin
* Suppose that $X_i$ are the parents' heights.
* Consider picking the slope $\beta$ that minimizes $$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i \beta)^2$$
* This is exactly using the origin as a pivot point picking the
line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances
of the points to the line
* Use R studio's  manipulate function to experiment
* Subtract the means so that the origin is the mean of the parent
and children's heights

```
myPlot <- function(beta){
  y <- galton$child - mean(galton$child)
  x <- galton$parent - mean(galton$parent)
  freqData <- as.data.frame(table(x, y))
  names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
  plot(
    as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$parent)), 
    as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$child)),
    pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
    cex = .15 * freqData$freq, 
    xlab = "parent", 
    ylab = "child"
    )
  abline(0, beta, lwd = 3)
  points(0, 0, cex = 2, pch = 19)
  mse <- mean( (y - beta * x)^2 )
  title(paste("beta = ", beta, "mse = ", round(mse, 3)))
}
manipulate(myPlot(beta), beta = slider(0.6, 1.2, step = 0.02))
```

## The solution 
### In the next few lectures we'll talk about why this is the solution
```{r}
lm(I(child - mean(child))~ I(parent - mean(parent)) - 1, data = galton)
```

---
## Visualizing the best fit line
### Size of points are frequencies at that X, Y combination
```{r, fig.height=5,fig.width=5,echo=FALSE}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
plot(as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$parent)), 
     as.numeric(as.vector(freqData$child)),
     pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
     cex = .05 * freqData$freq, 
     xlab = "parent", ylab = "child")
lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
lines(galton$parent,lm1$fitted,col="red",lwd=3)
```
